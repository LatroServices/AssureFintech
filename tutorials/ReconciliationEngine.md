# Reconcilation Engine
The **Reconciliation Engine** is a core component of the Assure Fintech platform, designed to ensure data consistency and integrity across systems. Reconciliation involves comparing two or more data sets to verify alignment and highlight any **discrepancies or exceptions** that may indicate leakage, fraud, or operational issues.

To view the reconciliation controls configured in the system, navigate to the [Control List](../tutorials/ControlList.md) page.
