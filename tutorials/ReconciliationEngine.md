# Reconcilation Engine
The **Reconciliation Engine** is a core backend component of Assure Fintech. It is designed to ensure data consistency and integrity across systems including third party reconciliation. Reconciliation involves comparing two or more data sets to verify alignment and highlight any **discrepancies or exceptions** that may indicate leakage, fraud, or operational issues.

To view the reconciliation controls configured in the system, navigate to the [Control List](../tutorials/ControlList.md) page and filter by "Control Type" of "Reconciliation".
